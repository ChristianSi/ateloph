Features to be included in rewrite
----------------------------------

* Unicode, check for Latin-1, convert if necessary
* Spaces at beginning of line should not disappear (main suspect: split)
* Make PHP unnecessary for web-view of logs (make logs html?)
* Expand links so the linked page's <title> is posted to the channel
    - python requests or urllib2?
* python.logging? (via andrej)

DONE (but needs testing):
* Reconnect automatically
* Show number of reconnects in bot nickname ("ateloph[0]", "ateloph[1]", etc)
